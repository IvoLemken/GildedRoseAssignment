# Gilded Rose Kata

The Gilded Rose Kata is a popular coding challenge that requires modifying an existing program that simulates the inventory management of a fictional item shop. The challenge involves adding new features to the program and refactoring the code to make it more maintainable and extensible. This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes) and can be found at https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose
